SUMMARY AND STEPS FOLLOWED:

1. First of all we tried to append the steering angles with its corresponding images.(driving_data.py)
2. Next we tried to convert the steering angles to radians.
3. We splitted the data into train and test (70-30 ratio respectively). 
4. Then we splitted the data into batches of size 100 LoadTrainBatch and LoadValBatch (the functions are called in train.py)
5. Next we tried to construct our CNN model (model.py). We added 5 convulational layers and used relu activation function in all of them.
6. We added 4 dropout layers with 0.5 rate. (As instructed in the assignment)
7. In the last layer we added keras.activation.linear function instead of atanh.
8. Finally in train.py file, we used adam optimizer rate of 1e-3 but it didn't helped in succesfully execute the model i.e., 
   the steering wheel doesn't rotated. So we changed  the value to 1e-4, which significantly improved the performace and rotated 
   the steering wheel. 
9. During training the model the logs and loss are stored in a directory called save.
10. Finally in run_dataset.py, we changed the rotation degrees to radians from data.txt file (same as above).
11. We runned a while loop in which with respect to each log that we got after training we rotated the steering wheel, simultanesously 
    we displayed the image frames. The observation of the same was phenomenal.
